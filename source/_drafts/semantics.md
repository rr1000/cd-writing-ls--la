### Products

Recently there has been a rise in the term **Product** being prepended to titles like Designer and Engineer (within the last five years - excluding titles like Product Officer and the alternate for Industrial Designer). This is likely in reaction to the plethora of non-descript job titles that have plagued the tech industry since the 90's. The term Product has always done a fine job of explaining what the person at a company does. Modern software development and the companies empowering a particular product vision have employees focusing on the whole concept of _the_ product, it's relation to how they make money, and ultimately a stronger focus on the experience users have.

[Palantir](//www.palantir.com/engineering-culture/), one of the richest privately held technology organizations in the world considers everyone at the company an engineer. Which of course begs the question, if everyone is an engineer then isn't no one?

In most situations I think it makes sense to remove the term engineer and instead opt for the ever recognizable _developer_. However I wouldn't recommend doing this. There's a strong correlation between calling yourself and Engineer and earning a higher wage (even when the required skills are the exact same).

This isn't a motivation to completely rid the industry of the job title of engineer. I think there are clear indications on when to use it; the person you are hiring has a Software Engineering degree and is performing the duties of a Software Engineer (ie. applying engineering principles to system design).

### The dead horse

There's no shortage of discussion on appropriate job titles in the tech industry. If you're unfamiliar here's a little [taste](//css-tricks.com/job-titles-in-the-web-industry/) [here](//essays.davidchouinard.com/product-engineer), [here](//www.softwareengineerinsider.com/articles/software-development-software-engineering.html#.Vrg3GDYrJE5) and [here&hellip;](//programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/4951/what-are-the-key-differences-between-software-engineers-and-programmers)

&hellip;and of course the [holy grail](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.112837.37), but those are just the tip of the iceberg. If you're involved in the tech industry no doubt you've heard at least half of those job titles. You've even likely had more than one. Aside from the obvious points of conflation; User Interface Engineer, Front-end Developer, JavaScript Engineer, etc. you'll often find yourself confused on what to put on your resume or what to search for when looking for a new job.

### "Real" engineers

One of the hotter points of contention is the use of the term _Engineer_. In most engineering professions you simply can't get an engineering job without an engineering degree. In fact in most modern countries the use of the term Engineer is closely regulated. In the United States it's the responsibility of each state to license engineers. However it's unclear on how well each state is doing. There also exists industrial exemption clauses which allow engineers without degrees to call themselves such.

Regulation around the title of Software Engineer is essentially non-existent. For the most part if you can prove competence and the necessary skill set for a Software Engineering job you're more than likely to receive it. I actually think this is a good thing, but that's not what this article is about. This article is about semantics. This article is about _what_ we should call Software Engineers without degrees.

### Duties of the job

The biggest distinction between a Software Engineer and a Software Developer is that Engineers <span class="hl">employ traditional engineering practices</span> to the design of their systems. One could make the argument that developers can also apply these same principles, but often they are not trained to do so properly.

One of the most important aspects of titling yourself appropriately is understanding the required duties of the job. If you're writing software you're programming. If you're programming you're likely thinking about systems and how they connect. If you're following a strict set of requirements that if are deviated from could have potential life threatening consequences you're likely an engineer. If you're programming an interface for a Twitter clone you're likely not an engineer (specifically bootcamps pumping out Rails developers calling themselves Software Engineers).

### When regulation makes sense

As a designer I'm mostly splitting my time evenly between
