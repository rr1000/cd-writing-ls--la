### Introduction

_Remote Foundations_ is a two part series on the benefits of working remotely. Part 1 focused on tips for employees. Read that [here](/remote) TODO: FIX THIS LINK. Part 2 (this post) will be focused on the organizational structure of remote teams. Specifically on how to organize your teams, develop communication through a culture of transparency, and instill working modes of innovation.

Successful remote work does not come down to a single tip or list of tricks. Remote working is comprised of very difficult and complex tasks. No one is going to give you a secrete recipe on how to build your remote empire. Management is not a profession of equality. Consequently everything and everyone must be treated as an individual instance.

As an organizational structure, remote work is very polarizing. If you follow any technocrats on twitter, hackernews, et al you'll notice right away that people have strong opinions. Many people think innovation can only happen spontainiously. You'll see comments about the necessity to be together early on in the genesis of a company. They'll point to conversations that happened over lunch or that company team building exercise that sparked the next great feature or product.

On the flip side you'll see others pointing to large open source efforts, like linux distributions, and programming languages as examples of great innovations achieved by working remotely.

The pool of excuses that remote work nay sayers can pick from in 2016 is becoming shallower and shallower. Communication tools have never been better. Collaboration tools have never been better. The availability of knowledge work has never been greater. Through effective team building, strong methods of communication, and an unrelenting passion for quality, remote will not only work for your organization, but drastically improve every aspect of your business.

### Teams

People are often cited as the most important aspect of any institution, and I'm inclined to agree. Customers and users are certainly vital to a companies success, but without quality people it becomes extremely difficult to build anything of value. The way you organize your people lays the foundation of your management system. Create a weak foundation and your machine will crumble.

You need to be successful at building teams regardless if you're a remote company or a location-dictated one. However there is a bit more nuance when it comes to building remote.

**Communication**

When hiring new remote employees it's important to gauge how well you think they'll succeed in being a remote communicator. You can do this by examining their telecommunication effectiveness during the interviewing process. It's common to have several phone calls, hangout sessions and even in person interviews with candidates. When you find yourself in these interactions write down on a 1-5 scale (1 being not so great) how well they did in each of the following categories:

- The candidate was responsive and followed up in a reasonable amount of time.
- The candidate was able to thoroughly communicate complex ideas and thoughts via text (email or chat).
- The candidate was able to thoroughly communicate complex ideas and thoughts via video chat (or in person when applicable).
- I was able to read the candidates emotions via text (email or chat).
- I was able to read the candidates emotions via video chat (or in person when applicable).

Rating candidates on these aspects is important for team building. You'll want to pair employees up accordingly. If you've got two highly productive engineers that are both 2's in all communication categories you might find that team being silo'd off. Simply adding a 3 or 4 to the team can give a tremendous boost to their engagement with the rest of the company.

The worst communication outcome of team building is having meetings and online discussions with no one participating. I've been in this situation and the silence is not only awkward, but contagious. This is why it's important to strike a healthy balance. Too much chatter can be distracting. Too little can lead to confusion.

> "..but communication is key for all teams, not just remote ones"

..that's exactly correct. Communication is no more important in a remote team than it is in a location-dictated one. However the ability to nurture and develop those communication techniques become a team effort with remote work. Rather than the typical manage->mentor relationship you see in location-dictated work places.

**Collaboration**

What would a team be without collaboration other than a group of people disparately working on some nebulous idea?

Much like having a license to Adobe PhotoShop doesn't make you a designer, having a slack and github account doesn't make you an effective remote team. However it does become difficult to talk about collaboration without at least mentioning categories of tools.

For design, engineerings and management teams (which is all I can speak to), these are the tools that are vital for collaboration:

- Cloud storage (Dropbox, Box, etc.)
- Shared credentials (Meldium, keyPaas, etc.)
- Chat (Slack, HipChat, Messenger, etc.)
- Video Chat (Hangouts, Skype, etc.)
- Conferencing (HipDial, GoToMeeting, JoinMe, etc.)
- Version Control (Github, GitLab, etc.)
- Feedback (Wake, Slack posts, Dropbox comments, etc.)
- Inspiration (Niice, Dropbox, Slack channel, etc.)
- Documentation (Wiki or roll your own)
- Project management (Trello, Asana, Pivotal Tracker, etc.)

Between remote and location-dictated work, the big difference is the ability to drive these collaborative tools through a single interface. So far the best tool for that job has been Slack. With the help of Zapier and many built in integrations, Slack has completely transformed how teams stay up to date with each other.

When everyone is physically together it's much easier to conviene in the conference room with a white board and some markers. It's easier to pull up some chairs into a circle and start sketching ideas with your neighbor. The necessity to push these collaborative efforts though a single interface becomes less and less necessary when everyone is within the same four walls, but is this a good thing?

I'd argue that it is not. Often times this type of behavior breads bad habits. Shoulder tapping, context switching, wheel spinning all run rampant at these types of companies. It's a free for all that may lead to some sarendipitous moments, but most of the time employees loathe working at these places.

When collaboration events (meetings, whiteboarding sessions, innovative brainstorming) are necessary they should be treated with a high level of regimine.
