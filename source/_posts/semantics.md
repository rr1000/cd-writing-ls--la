There's no horse more dead than the one that involves job titles in the technology industry. If you're unfamiliar here's a little [taste&hellip;](https://css-tricks.com/job-titles-in-the-web-industry/)

&hellip;and that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. If you're involved in the tech industry no doubt you've heard at least half of those job titles. You've even likely occupied more than one. Aside from the obvious points of conflation: UI Engineer, Front-end Developer, JavaScript Engineer, etc. you'll often find yourself confused on what to put on your resume or what to search for when looking for a new job.

### "Real" engineers

One of the hotter points of contention is the use of the term _Engineer_. In most engineering professions outside of technology you simply can't get an engineering job without an engineering degree. In fact in most modern countries the use of the term Engineer is closely regulated. In the United States it's the responsibility of each state to license engineers. However it's unclear on how well each state is doing. There also exists industrial exemption clauses which allow engineers without degrees to call themselves such.

In the technology industry the title of Engineer is even less regulated. For the most part if you can prove competence and the necessary skill set for a Software Engineering job you're more than likely to receive it. Now don't get me wrong. I think this is a good thing, but that's not what this article is about. This article is about semantics. This article is about _what_ we should call Software Engineers without degrees, because they are not engineers.

### Duties of the job

One of the most important aspects of titling yourself appropriately is understanding the required duties of the job. If you're writing software you're programming. If you're programming you're likely thinking about systems and how they connect. Often times what separates a Software Engineer and a Software Developer is the industries they occupy. If you're following a strict set of requirements that if are deviated from could have potential life threatening consequences you're likely engineering. If you're programming an interface for a Twitter clone you're likely not engineering.

### Software products

Recently there has been a rise in the term **Product** being prepended to other titles like Designer and Engineer.

### Potential solutions

- `Product Designer` to replace UI/UX Designer, Visual Designer, Web Designer
- `Product Developer` to replace Front-end Developer, UI Developer, JavaScript Engineer
- `Software Developer` to replace Software Engineer (sans degree), Programmer, Full-stack Developer, Back-end Developer






Potential Titles:

  - The Product
  - Designing for Sustainable Business

Reasons for writing this article:

  - The proliferation of the Product Designer within the tech industry
  - More companies are starting to understand that you have to make money (history always repeats itself)
  - Fear and self doubt

I've spent much of my career as a designer focusing on creating digital products for the web (often called web applications, sometimes referred to as websites). The bulk of this article is going to focus on my current understanding of a product.

In college I helped create a software as a service company that gave teachers the ability to grade multiple choice tests simply by taking a picture of the answer sheet. The part I was responsible for was mostly the design and development of the front-end web application. The product.

When I worked for a creative agency I spent a lot of time helping design and develop small ruby applications that helped various companies achieve various things. To them I was building their product. To their end users, we produced their product.

I'm now working on a number of different products at Catalyze as a designer. Everyday is an attempt to empower my team to align quality design with the monetary goals of the business.

Design within the context of a sustainable business must first succeed at turning a profit. Good design within the context of a sustainable business is first established using appropriate design principles, and then tweaked and grown in order to turn a profit. Design that succeeds at turning a profit over another is considered the best design within the context of that sustainable business. An example of a poor (potentially a life threatening) design being the best design for a specific business is the inhaler. An inhaler functions a certain way because it keeps the patient alive, but still sick. The inhaler can be designed more efficiently (for the patient - many companies have done this), but that’s not the goal of the business. Without someone needing an inhaler the company that makes the inhaler ceases to exist. Therefore the inhaler is the appropriate design because it delivers a base level of functionality so that it has a place, at the same time being inefficient enough for the company to continue making a profit (the patient is still sick, but alive so they can pay). These combined outcomes make the inhaler a perfect design.

I call this portion "the product" not to belittle or down play the engineering that went into the backend functionality, but because to an end user, the thing they interact with, the thing that has buttons and animations and text, is the product. That's what they use. That's what they pay for, and that's how they perceive you as a company.

What is a sustainable business? When I say sustainable business' I'm referring to companies that focus more on revenue than raising money, that attempt to tie every function of their company to a dollar amount, that don't spend months convincing rich guys in suits that they are really worth this much because they have this many users (and 0 fucking revenue).

Design within the context of a sustainable business must focus on aligning quality visual and experience design with the monetary goals of the business. The less these two concepts appose each other the more you succeed in designing the best product.

Designing a product is an attempt to align quality design with the monetary goals of the business.

What makes a design good? Are things that make a design good for a non-profit the same as what makes a design good for a for-profit?

A well designed product is comprised of the following layers:

  - Quality design principles (The base layer - without a quality base your structure eventually fails)
  - A differentiator (Kevin Hale does a great job of explaining wufoo's eccentric design as a differentiator [delight])
  -

Reducing subjectivity.
