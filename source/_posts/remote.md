### Introduction

It's safe to say that remote work has earned its place at the head table among effective organizational structures. This type of work is the future of employment, especially in the technology industry. _Remote Foundations_ is a two part series on the benefits of working remotely. Part 1 focuses on tips for employees.

If you're a new remote employee it can be both exciting and intimidating. When starting my remote career I found that literature on the topic was few and far between. Since then I have dedicated much of my free time to writing and thinking about remote work. In 2016 I plan on publishing and sharing that work here on my blog.

Below I've listed six key areas of focus for new remote employees. These are essential in getting off on the right foot.

### 1. FOMO

Fear of missing out is inevitable. As you work with your new team and get to know each other it will eventually go away. Companies can help mitigate this by valuing transparency (I'll talk more to that point in _Part 2_). Employees can help mitigate this by disconnecting and distancing themselves from technology when they are not working. We live in a hyperconnected world. One in which maintaining your mental health is nearly impossible once you've become addicted to constantly being online.

Something that really helped me achieve this disconnection was reading more physical books. At first I set my goals very high at three books per month. In reality that was too ambitious. The right balance was one book per month of longer length (or two shorter ones). When selecting works I found benefit alternating between fiction and non-fiction.

### 2. Outdoors

It's easy to get glued to your screen pumping out work. When I first started working remotely I would work before I got ready for the day, all day, during lunch, after going to the gym, before eating dinner, after eating dinner and just before bed. This was purely self inflicted. I couldn't separate `being at home and working` with `being at home and not working`. What really helped me was being able to go outside for an hour each day to disconnect from technology.

One advantage of working remotely is that in most cases you decide where you want to work. Given today's WiFi and cell service coverage it's quite possible todo your work in the woods, atop a mountain, or on the beach. You should explore working outside. You might be surprised how productive and inspired you can be.

### 3. Scheduling

Fail to set a schedule and you'll find yourself working very odd hours. Set a schedule to the hour in your calendar app. Make sure that notifications are turned on so you know when to start and stop working. Eventually you'll be able to wean yourself off of this process, but it certainly helps in the beginning to strictly adhere to it.

You'll also want to mercilessly cull both your inbox and notifications. There is nothing more distracting than having a littered inbox with it constantly badgering you to check your phone or switch browser tabs. If you get into a routine of having notifications continually going off the above scheduling process simply won't work. You'll tune out the scheduled activities along with the other nonsense wasting your time.

### 4. Async

Asking questions and conversing with co-workers are important interactions to any job. When you're working remotely it's not uncommon for people to have varying schedules across several timezones. When asking questions and posting feedback you may not hear back from others for a while. This can often be frustrating so it's important to always have backup projects and tasks that you can work on while waiting.

An even better solution to the async problem is reducing your dependency on others. If you can produce your work with minimal interactions with others the better. That's not to say teamwork shouldn't be valued and encouraged. However most daily tasks should be completed independently.

### 5. Management

Self managing is perhaps the most important aspect of being a productive remote employee. Companies that have great organizational structures will often have employees that just _know_ what they should be doing. They know how to set expectations and meet their own goals. They are driven by an unrelenting passion for the product. They don't need managers breathing down their necks micromanaging their every move.

In some regard remote work has been criticized for this very aspect. Citing that it's too hard to find 10xers like this. I'd argue that this isn't true. Given the right onboarding scenario, where expectations are clearly set, most new employees are capable of self managing. In the end, being a great self manager is about valuing the work you put out.

### 6. Friends

It's likely that your core group of friends are co-workers. When you're working remotely over large geological distances it's difficult to be close friends with your co-workers. This is why it's important to make other friends in your area. A great way to do this is by frequenting co-working spaces and meeting other folks who also work remotely.
