Designers are trained to preform many tasks, but most importantly they are taught the fundamentals of planning, systematizing and executing a concept. As new markets emerge and software continues to eat the world it seems the tech industry is more focused than ever on dividing these bits of training into [multiple roles with multiple titles](http://css-tricks.com/job-titles-in-the-web-industry/).

Engineers are not expected to only write about and document their work. They must build and test. They must maintain. There's a necessity to shape their craft from many outlets.

In this regard designers should be held to the same standard. Unfortunately it seems designers are getting worse at accomplishing one aspect of design over another, and so they ignore it and latch onto a term that purposefully disregards that aspect. The rise of the UX designer is a perfect example of this. Designers should be expected to incorporate all aspects of design into their daily work.
